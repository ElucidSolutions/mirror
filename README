Mirror Readme
=============

The Mirror utility can be used to mirror local directories on remote
servers over SFTP using WinSCP. When run, this utility will fork a
WinSCP process for each project directory listed in config.json. These
WinSCP processes will monitor the project directory that they are
associated with for any changes and immediately sync them with the
associated remote directory.

This utility was created as part of Elucid's Standard Dev Environment
specification.

Known Issues
============

The current version of this utility does not close the WinSCP processes
that it spawns when terminated. These have to be terminated seperately.
