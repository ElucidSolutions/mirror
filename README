Mirror Readme
=============

The Mirror utility can be used to mirror local directories on remote
servers over SFTP using WinSCP. When run, this utility will fork a
WinSCP process for each connection listed in mirror.json. These
WinSCP processes will monitor the local directory that they are
associated with for any changes and immediately sync mirror those
changes in the associated remote directory.

This program provides a webinterface on port 3000. You can view, start,
and stop connections using this interface by navigating your browser to
http://localhost:3000.

This utility was created as part of Elucid's Standard Dev Environment
specification.

Tips
====

1. Default File Masks

   It is possible to specify a set of default file masks in WinSCP and
   have them applied automatically whenever mirror is run. This can be
   usefully for example when dealing with binary files or when a project
   is under Git version control. To create a default file mask:

      1. Open WinSCP.
      2. On the Login screen, click the Tools button and select Preferences.
      3. On the Preferences screen, select Transfer in the left-most menu.
      4. Click the Edit button in the dialogue window.
      5. On the Transfer Settings screen, enter your file masks in the
         File Mask text area.
      6. Click the OK button to save your changes.


Known Issues
============

1. The user interface only displays an error when WinSCP terminates and
   returns an error code. WinSCP may stop mirroring a directory without
   terminating and may even return "successful" after closing due to
   an error. Moreover, the user interface only lists a connection as
   "Stopped" if the WinSCP process that was handling the connection has
   terminated. WinSCP may stop mirroring a directory without closing.
   In which case, the user interface will continue to list the
   connection as "Running". As a result, the status displayed in the
   user interface may be incorrect.
